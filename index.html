            <p style="text-align: justify;">A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications, server-side applications, or both.</p>
